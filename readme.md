#Positivus

This is my first ever HTML CSS Project Made during my training at RYAZ.io

##Points to Note!

The file styles.css was made by traditional approach so my mentor sir suggested me to create it using BEM approach, and styles2.scss is made using the same. and scss is compiled into styles-new.css using npm and same file is used in index.html

##Instructions to compile .scss to .css

<<-Make Sure to have npm & sass installed->>

```bash
sass --watch styles2.scss:styles-new.css
```


Thankyou!
